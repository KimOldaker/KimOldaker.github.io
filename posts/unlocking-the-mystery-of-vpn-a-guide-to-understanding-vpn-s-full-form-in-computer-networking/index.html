Understanding How VPN Works in Computer Network<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#1-understanding-how-vpn-works-in-computer-network>#</a></h3><p>Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a technology used to create a secure connection between two or more computers in a computer network. VPNs are widely used to protect user privacy and data from malicious attacks or intercepts. The technology works by using a combination of encryption and tunneling protocols to protect data as it travels over the internet from one device to another. VPNs create an encrypted tunnel between a user&rsquo;s computer and the VPN server, which enables secure data transmission. VPNs also provide a tunnel for the data traffic to traverse, which makes it difficult for hackers to intercept or alter the data. Additionally, VPNs provide anonymity by using a virtual IP address instead of the real one, so your identity remains protected. By using a VPN, data is encrypted and secured, allowing users to access the internet safely and securely.</p><h3 id=2-advantages-of-using-a-vpn-in-computer-network>2. Advantages of Using a VPN in Computer Network<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-advantages-of-using-a-vpn-in-computer-network>#</a></h3><p>Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a technology that is used to create secure connection over public networks. It provides a secure tunnel between two or more devices to protect data being sent and received. VPN creates a secure tunnel by using encryption protocols, like OpenVPN, PPTP, SSTP, and L2TP/IPSec.</p><p>Once a secure connection is established, users can send data securely over public networks that can only be accessed by those users who have permission. This means that no matter who is on the same network, they cannot access the data.</p><p>Furthermore, VPN can be used to bypass network restrictions and access websites that are blocked from certain locations. It is also used for extra protection when connecting to Wi-Fi hotspots and to avoid geographical restrictions of specific websites.</p><p>In conclusion, VPN is a technology used to create secure connection over public networks. It provides a secure tunnel between two or more devices to protect data from snooping and to bypass network restrictions and access websites that are blocked from certain locations.</p><h2 id=3-advantages-of-using-vpn-in-computer-network>3.
