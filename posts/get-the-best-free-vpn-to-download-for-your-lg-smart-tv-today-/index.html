A1: VPN stands for Virtual Private Network. It’s a type of online service that provides individuals with secure access to their personal data and online activities, and also allows organizations to protect their networks from external threats. A VPN connection is made by encrypting traffic and routing it through an encrypted tunnel between the user&rsquo;s device and the VPN server. This makes it impossible for anyone to access the user&rsquo;s data, giving them an extra layer of protection against cyber threats.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://kimoldaker.github.io/posts/get-access-to-the-internet-with-free-vpn-for-android-tv-box-apk/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Get Access to the Internet with Free VPN for Android TV Box APK</span></a>
