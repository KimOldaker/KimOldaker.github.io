Reddit users generally agree that the best free VPN for Android is Reddit’s own ProtonVPN. While free VPNs might not offer the same level of encryption and security as paid ones, they still have some advantages. To help you make an informed decision, here is a break down of the pros and cons of ProtonVPN and its competitors on Reddit.\nProtonVPN offers reliable encryption, with a no-logs policy, making it a secure and reliable VPN choice for Android users.

Additionally, ProtonVPN is open-source and user-oriented, with a very active community of developers working to keep it up-to-date.\nOn the other hand, free VPN options from third-party providers can be riddled with security issues.

However, it does have one major downside - it doesn’t offer a free trial, so you’ll have to commit to the service before you can use it.\nOverall, when it comes to choosing the best free VPN for Android Reddit users can get a lot of useful information.
