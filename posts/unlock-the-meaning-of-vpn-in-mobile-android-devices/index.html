With the advent of technology, smartphones have become the most common way for us to access the internet. With an ever-increasing number of applications for mobile devices, we need to make sure our data is secure. Setting up a Virtual Private Network (VPN) on your mobile Android device is an easy way to protect your digital identity and keep your personal data safe. Here&rsquo;s how to set up VPN on your Android device.</p><p>Firstly, find a compatible VPN provider for your Android device. Most respectable providers will have an app for Android that you can easily find and download from the Google Play store. Once downloaded and installed, open the application and enter your credentials before connecting to the VPN.</p><p>Secondly, confirm that your VPN is connected by looking for a lock icon in the notification bar of your device. If the icon appears, your VPN is connected and your device is protected. You can also go to your device&rsquo;s settings to confirm that the VPN is connected.</p><p>Thirdly, if you want to change locations, you need to disconnect the current VPN connection and select a different server from the list of available locations. Once you have selected the new location, simply reconnect and you will have your VPN set up in your new location.</p><p>Finally, check your IP address to make sure that your VPN is working. You can do this by visiting an IP checking website. If your IP address changes to the one of the VPN provider, then you know that your VPN is working correctly on your mobile Android device.</p><h3 id=1-configuring-vpn-on-android-devices>1.
